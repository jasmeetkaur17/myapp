<h2>Authentication Rules</h2>
<p>The ultimate goal of the information security process is to protect three unique attributes of information. They are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> – Information should only be seen by those persons authorized to see it. Information could be confidential because it is proprietary information that is created and owned by the organization or it may be customers’ personal information that must be kept confidential due to legal responsibilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> – Information must not be corrupted, degraded, or modified. Measures must be taken to insulate information from accidental and deliberate change.</li></ul>
